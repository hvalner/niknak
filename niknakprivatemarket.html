        <h2><a style="color: #4ac1d2;" target="_blank" href="https://www.antsylabs.com/products/fidget-cube?gclid=CO6Fk6iZ9tICFRCZfgod9ekPSw">Industry</a></h2>
        <p>
        The retail market for toys in the US has a yearly revenue of $30.4 billion and $1.4 billion in profit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The barrier to entry into this industry is of moderate difficulty, the main challenge being a high saturation of products in the market. We aim to work around this challenge by focusing in specific markets, such as the USC community.

        <h2>Competition</h2>
            <h3><a class="competition" target="_blank" href="https://www.antsylabs.com/products/fidget-cube?gclid=CO6Fk6iZ9tICFRCZfgod9ekPSw"> Fidget Cube</a></h3>
                <p>
                First to market and popularized by a wildly successful kickstarter campaign, the Fidget Cube helped bring fidget toys center stage. The current price for this product is $22.00 and if ordered at the current time will not ship until April 2017, or until all the previous orders from the Kickstarter campaign are fulfilled.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3><a class="competition" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_p_36_5?rnid=386491011&keywords=fidget+spinner&rh=n%3A165793011%2Ck%3Afidget+spinner&qid=1490602362&low-price=0&high-price=10&x=10&y=8"> Amazon </a></h3>
                <p>
                Prices range from $2.00 - $150.00 and there are offerings of various styles. The two most prominent styles are those mimicking the Fidget Cube and others are the spinner style. Our advantage in the market is in shipping time, as our product is immediately available.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3><a class="competition" target="_blank" href="https://www.walmart.com/search/?query=fidget%20spinner&typeahead=fidget"> Wallmart</a></h3>
                <p>
                The fidget spinners available from Wallmart are similar in style to the product we offer. The prices range from $6.00 - $18.00, shipping included. The products would arrive 5-7 business days after ordering. Again, our advantage is in immediate fulfillment of our product.
