        The Deal--Funding Proposal // Projections // Deal Terms <br> <br>
        </div>
    <div class=roles>
        We are looking for an initial fund of $85 to jump start our small business. The entirety of this initial capital will go toward materials for manufacturing. We have finalized two different designs that we plan to roll out as our initial product skews. With free product samples from Chinese suppliers we have created small batches of products to perform market research and generate buzz around our product. This has been a very helpful stage that has given us insight into design changes, price point, and where we can impact the fidget toy market. <br><br>
	As mention, this initial investment will go towards acquiring the materials necessary for our first batch of Nik Nak fidget toys. We have been in contact with a supplier in China and have made deal to purchase bearings at the lowest possible price point. Our deal with the Chinna supplier is for 200 bearings for $88 including shipping. We were able to sell two initial prototypes made from the free samples we received to generate the $3 extra dollars. This price per bearing is the lowest possible we could get at this quantity and will bring our production cost per spinner to around $2.50. <br><br>
	After our market research, we feel that we can impact the market most at a price point of $5-$7 per spinner meaning we anticipate generating $125-$225 in profit. With this profit we plan to acquire more materials for production, most likely re-upping on the same deal of 200 bearings for $88. After purchasing more materials we will have a net profit of $37-$137. Depending on the price point of our spinners we will be able to repay between 43.5% - 100% of your loan. <br><br>
	As for our timeline we believe we can sell out our first batch of Nik Naks in 1-2 weeks, thus you will be able to see a return by the middle of April. Your funding will be fully repaid by the end of April. Due to the scale of the initial funding we are not looking to give up any equity and are aiming to borrow your money at a 0% interest rate. Going forward we anticipating need more capital and are open to discussing equity or loans with interest rates at a higher volume once our production capabilities and business platform are perfected and proven.
